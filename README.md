Because of the lack of time, we have not developed a comfortable interface,
so to generate any graph you should enter the initial data directly. 
Note: there entered text should be typed with no mistakes. Moreover, 
be sure that relevant data is present in both datasets “c19cases” 
and “waqi-covid19-airqualitydata-2020.csv”
